- [x] .env.example created
- [x] Core modules implemented
- [x] Initial test added

## Implementation Order:
1. [x] Configuration management (src/config/settings.py)
2. [x] Data models (src/models/data_models.py)
3. [x] Segmentation model (src/models/segmentation.py)
4. [x] Feature engineering service (src/services/feature_engineering.py)
5. [x] Prediction service (src/services/prediction.py)
6. [x] Utilities (src/utils/logger.py)
7. [x] API main (src/api/main.py)
8. [x] API routes (src/api/routes/segmentation.py)
9. [x] Test implementation (tests/test_segmentation.py)
10. [x] Demo notebook (notebooks/demo.ipynb)

## âœ… IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

All core modules have been successfully implemented with:
- Configuration management with environment variables
- Pydantic data models for validation
- K-Means clustering segmentation model
- Feature engineering pipeline
- Prediction service with confidence scoring
- Comprehensive logging
- FastAPI REST endpoints
- Complete test suite
- Interactive demo notebook

### To run the system:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train model using the demo notebook
3. Start API: `uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload`
4. Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs for API documentation
